### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Marlon is here

I started my IT career through college (EAD) and already in the first months of the course, due to dedication and study on website development, I got my first internship working with PHP OO, it was a brief experience but it allowed me to reach new opportunities in the market, and with each new challenge I improved my knowledge about web development, eventually I had contact with frontend frameworks (angular, react, vue) and nodejs on the backend to build a 100% javascript application.

## Game developer carrer ðŸŽ®
Playing video games is a lot of fun, but you know what? build your own is better.
  
Since feb 2021 I have been studying and executing game development independently, which allowed me to have more affinity with python, and thus a more cautious view on development, as the CORE of a game is an event loop with tick frame by frame, and nodejs pretty much does this in its event loop.
  
keep watching and follow my journey, maybe you'll play and have fun with my games ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
