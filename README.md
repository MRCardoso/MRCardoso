### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Marlon is here

I started my IT career through college (EAD) and already in the first months of the course, due to dedication and study on website development, I got my first internship working with PHP OO, it was a brief experience but it allowed me to reach new opportunities in the market, and with each new challenge I improved my knowledge about web development, eventually I had contact with frontend frameworks (angular, react, vue) and nodejs on the backend to build a 100% javascript application.

## Game developer carrer ðŸŽ®
Playing video games is a lot of fun, but you know what? build your own is better.
  
Since feb 2021 I have been studying and executing game development independently, which allowed me to have more affinity with python, and thus a more cautious view on development, as the CORE of a game is an event loop with tick frame by frame, and nodejs pretty much does this in its event loop.
